Repo to download helpful files for Crowbar compilation and vmt editing
1) samplea_physics.smd is a physics model from Deadwater's Guide edited by myself to be closer to the default Vroid model body. Using this smd instead of the one provided in Deadwater's guide reduces the overall time needed to edit the physics smd by providing one that's much closer to the Vroid body by default.
2) basewarp.vtf is used by the vmt files as a sort of 'base' and is necesary to correctly display the textures in-game.
3) vmts.txt contains vmt parameters for each part of a Vroid model. It includes code defining parameters for the Head, Face texture (separate because it uses its own normal), Body, Clothing, and Hair.
