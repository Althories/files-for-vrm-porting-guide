# files-for-vrm-porting-guide
Repo to download helpful files for Crowbar compilation and vmt editing. The associated Steam Guide can be found here: [insert link]

1) basewarp.vtf is used by the vmt files as a sort of 'base' and is necesary to correctly display the textures in-game.
2) samplea_physics.smd/samplec_physics.smd are physics models from Deadwater's Guide edited by myself to be closer to the default Vroid female/male bodies. Using one of these smds instead of the one provided in Deadwater's guide reduces the overall time needed to edit the physics smd by providing one that's much closer to the Vroid body by default.
3) vmts.txt contains vmt parameters for each part of a Vroid model. It includes code defining parameters for the Head, Face texture (separate because it uses its own normal), Body, Clothing, and Hair.
